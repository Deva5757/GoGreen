                <p>Sandalwood is a class of woods from trees in the genus Santalum. The woods are heavy, yellow, and
                    fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades.
                    Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods for use. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most
                    expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has
                    been highly valued for centuries. Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have
                    suffered over-harvesting in the past.</p>

                <img src="Assets/Redsandal_seeds.jpg" alt="">
                <p>P. santalinus, commonly known as Red Sandalwood, is a native and endemic to India and can only be
                    found in the southern parts of the Eastern Ghats. It is a small tree that grows to 5-8 meters in
                    height and has a dark grayish bark. The timber is highly demanded domestically and internationally,
                    and especially in East Asian countries. Red Sandalwood timber is used for carvings, furniture,
                    poles, and house posts. The rare “wavy” grain variant is highly valued in Japan for its acoustic
                    properties and is used to make musical instruments. In addition, the timber is also exploited for
                    the extraction of santalin (a red pigment used as dye and colorant in food), medicine and cosmetics.
                    Its IUCN Red List status is “endangered.”</p>

                <img src="Assets/neeam_seeds.jpg" alt="">
                <p>However, the exact origin is uncertain: some say neem is native to the whole Indian subcontinent;
                    others attribute it to dry forest areas throughout all of South and Southeast Asia, including
                    Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is in India that the tree is most widely
                    used.</p>
